# Blackjack Game
This is my basic blackjack game written in Haskell. It runs in a terminal window and allows the user to play against a dealer who follows a set of rules on whether to draw a card or fold. The user can decide whether or not to fold throughout the game.

## Running the game
Compile the Application with `ghc Game.hs --make`

Run the application with `./Game`

## Dependencies
```
sudo dnf install Haskell-Platform
Cabal install random-extras-0.19
```
